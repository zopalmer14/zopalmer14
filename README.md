👋🏽 Hi, my name is Zach Palmer

🎓 I am a junior pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Statistics. I expect to graduate in April 2023.

🌇 Buffalo native, with a passion for Data Science and Analytics.

📚 I am currently learning Web Development both in classes at Pitt and in my free time working on a personal website to showcase my projects and skills. Additionally, I am working with datasets to create models for sports analytics, like predicting team/player performance as well as using distributions of expected outcomes to inform decision making.

💻 In the future I hope to work as a Data Analyst or Software Engineer for a startup or tech company that offers me the opportunity to work with a diverse team doing impactful, fulfilling work in a collaborative environment focused on growth and building one another up. 

🏔 In my free time, you can find me playing soccer or video games, reading, working on projects, or out in nature hiking or backpacking.

💪🏽 I have attended multiple hackathons and coding competitions and have experience working in teams and collaborating with others under time crunches and in stressful situations. Additionally, I'm familiar with a number of programming languages for both front and back-end development including R, Java, HTML, and Python. I have significant experience with manipulating and visualizing datasets in R Studio and have completed multiple Data Science projects in my classes. I also have experience with Software Quality Assurance tools/frameworks like JUnit, Selenium IDE, and visualVM as well as with Electronic Privacy, including a little knowledge of Cryptography.
