👋🏽 Hi, my name is Zach Palmer

🎓 I am a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh, receiving a BS in Computer Science, a BS in Data Science, and a minor in Applied Statistics

📚 I am interested in applying my skills in data science and full-stack development to improve the equity of outcomes and prevent exploitation of vulnerable populations. Within data science, I also have a particular interest in sports analytics, using positional data and other statistics to create models predicting team/player performance as well as using distributions of expected outcomes to inform decision making. 

💻 I am currently working with the Department of Commerce on AI Data & Strategy initiatives, as a Data Science & Analytics Fellow within GSA's Digital Corps program.  

🏔 In my free time, you can find me rock climbing, playing soccer, reading, working on projects, or out in nature hiking or backpacking.

📊 I am proficient in a number of languages for both front and back-end development, as well as for data science/analytics, including R, Python, SQL, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among others. I have significant experience with manipulating and visualizing datasets in both R and Python using relevant libraries/packages like tidyverse and pandas and have completed multiple data science projects both in and outside of classes.
