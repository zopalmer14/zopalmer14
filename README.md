👋🏽 Hi, my name is Zach Palmer

🎓 I am a senior pursuing a BS in Computer Science, a BS in Data Science, and a minor in Applied Statistics. I expect to graduate in April 2023.

🌇 Buffalo native, with a passion for Data Science and Analytics.

📚 I am most interested in data science and am currently furthering my skills in this area both in classes at Pitt and in my free time working on personal projects to showcase my skills. Within data science, I also have a particular interest in sports analytics, using positional data and other statistics to create models predicting team/player performance as well as using distributions of expected outcomes to inform decision making.

💻 In the future I hope to work as a Data Scientist/Analyst or Full-Stack Software Engineer at a company that offers me the opportunity to work with a diverse team doing impactful, fulfilling work in a collaborative environment focused on growth. 

🏔 In my free time, you can find me rock climbing, playing soccer, reading, working on projects, or out in nature hiking or backpacking.

💪🏽 I have attended multiple hackathons and coding competitions and have experience working in teams and collaborating with others under time crunches and in stressful situations. Additionally, I am proficient in a number of languages for both front and back-end development, as well as for data science/analytics, including R, Python, SQL, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among others. I have significant experience with manipulating and visualizing datasets in both R and Python using relevant libraries/packages like tidyverse, pandas, and scikit-learn, and have completed multiple data science projects both in and outside of classes.
